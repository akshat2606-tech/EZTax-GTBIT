# EZTax WebApp

EZTax is a feature-rich web application designed to simplify financial tasks and tax-related processes. It integrates multiple advanced components such as a chatbot, recommendation system, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities to provide users with a seamless, AI-driven experience. By leveraging Function.Network‚Äôs API and Google Gemini‚Äôs generative capabilities, the platform offers intelligent data extraction, tax optimization, and personalized financial insights.

## üîπ Features

- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Chatbot (Tax Assistant):**  
  - Provides quick, accurate responses to tax-related questions.  
  - Integrates FAISS-based vector search for document retrieval.  
  - Leverages Function.Network‚Äôs API for conversational tasks and fallback queries.  

- ‚úÖ **Advanced Recommendation System:**  
  - Uses user-provided financial data to suggest tax-saving investments.  
  - Calculates tax liabilities under both old and new tax regimes.  
  - Provides detailed, actionable insights based on Indian tax laws.  

- ‚úÖ **OCR and Document Parsing:**  
  - Extracts key financial information from uploaded documents such as salary slips, investment statements, and invoices.  
  - Highlights important text regions with bounding boxes.  
  - Processes images efficiently using EasyOCR and enhanced preprocessing techniques.

## üìä How It Works

1. **User Input:**  
   - Upload financial documents (e.g., salary slips, investment proofs).  
   - Provide basic user details and financial data.  

2. **OCR and Data Extraction:**  
   - The OCR system identifies text within the documents, categorizes financial data, and extracts fields such as total amount, date, payment method, and tax-related identifiers.  
   - Annotated images with bounding boxes are generated for transparency and verification.  

3. **Chatbot Interaction:**  
   - The chatbot answers questions by retrieving relevant data from indexed documents.  
   - For queries requiring additional insights, it uses Function.Network‚Äôs API to generate comprehensive responses.  

4. **Recommendation System:**  
   - Analyzes extracted data and user inputs to compute tax liabilities under different regimes.  
   - Suggests tax-efficient investments and identifies potential savings.  
   - Outputs personalized, formatted reports.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EZTax.git
cd EZTax
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

**Backend:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Frontend (if applicable):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
FUNCTION_API_KEY=your_function_network_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY_2=your_gemini_api_key
```

**Note:** The provided code explicitly uses Function.Network‚Äôs API, so ensure that `FUNCTION_API_KEY` is correctly set in the environment file.

### 4. Run the Backend

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**Alternative (if using Flask):**
```bash
flask run
```

**API Access:**  
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` (if using FastAPI) to view the API documentation.  
- Use the `/chat` endpoint for the chatbot and the `/generate-report` endpoint for financial insights.
