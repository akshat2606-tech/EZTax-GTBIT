# EZTax WebApp

EZTax is a feature-rich web application designed to simplify financial tasks and tax-related processes. It integrates multiple advanced components such as a chatbot, recommendation system, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities to provide users with a seamless, AI-driven experience. By leveraging Function.Network’s API and Google Gemini’s generative capabilities, the platform offers intelligent data extraction, tax optimization, and personalized financial insights.

## 🔹 Features

- ✅ **Intelligent Chatbot (Tax Assistant):**  
  - Provides quick, accurate responses to tax-related questions.  
  - Integrates FAISS-based vector search for document retrieval.  
  - Leverages Function.Network’s API for conversational tasks and fallback queries.  

- ✅ **Advanced Recommendation System:**  
  - Uses user-provided financial data to suggest tax-saving investments.  
  - Calculates tax liabilities under both old and new tax regimes.  
  - Provides detailed, actionable insights based on Indian tax laws.  

- ✅ **OCR and Document Parsing:**  
  - Extracts key financial information from uploaded documents such as salary slips, investment statements, and invoices.  
  - Highlights important text regions with bounding boxes.  
  - Processes images efficiently using EasyOCR and enhanced preprocessing techniques.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **User Input:**  
   - Upload financial documents (e.g., salary slips, investment proofs).  
   - Provide basic user details and financial data.  

2. **OCR and Data Extraction:**  
   - The OCR system identifies text within the documents, categorizes financial data, and extracts fields such as total amount, date, payment method, and tax-related identifiers.  
   - Annotated images with bounding boxes are generated for transparency and verification.  

3. **Chatbot Interaction:**  
   - The chatbot answers questions by retrieving relevant data from indexed documents.  
   - For queries requiring additional insights, it uses Function.Network’s API to generate comprehensive responses.  

4. **Recommendation System:**  
   - Analyzes extracted data and user inputs to compute tax liabilities under different regimes.  
   - Suggests tax-efficient investments and identifies potential savings.  
   - Outputs personalized, formatted reports.
